## üîî Forecast Logic & Sales Alerts

### SQL-Based Alert Rules:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è *Low Forecasted RS*: If forecasted sales < 3-month average  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è *Inefficient Ad Spend*: If ad spend/GMV ratio drops  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è *Event-Aware*: Adjust alerts during high-sales holiday months

Used these rules to highlight SKUs that may require intervention or deeper analysis.

---

## üí° Business Recommendations

- **Double down on Balance Foam**: High ROI with relatively low cost base.
- **Reassess investment** in low-ROI categories like heavy dumbbells.
- **Diversify product mix**: Consider testing lighter or seasonal fitness gear.
- **Use alerts** to trigger review of forecast accuracy before inventory lock-in dates.
